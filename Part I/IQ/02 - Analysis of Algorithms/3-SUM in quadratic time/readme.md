## 3-SUM in quadratic time

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n2 in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the n integers in time proportional to n2 or better.
